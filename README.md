# Two-player Bayesian Nash Equilibrium Solver

This repo contains a simple BNE solver for a two-player Bayesian game (in normal form) with multiple types for both players.

The code currently solves the following:
* BNE under ex-ante expected utility (Player doesn't know his type, nor other's type)

The code will also solve the following:
* BNE under interim expected utility (Player doesn't know other's type, but he knows his own type)
